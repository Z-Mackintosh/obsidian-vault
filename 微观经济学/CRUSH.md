# CRUSH.md - Microeconomics Study Repository

## Repository Overview
This repository contains study notes and practice problems for **Intermediate Microeconomics (范里安)** after completing introductory economics (曼昆). Focuses on mathematical rigor and advanced concepts beyond introductory level.

## Repository Structure
- **笔记/**: Main study notes organized by chapter (1.导论.md, 2.预算约束.md, etc.)
- **例题/**: Practice problems and solutions (包络定理.md, 消费者剩余.md, etc.)
- Files use Chinese naming with chapter numbers and descriptive titles

## Content Guidelines
- **Language**: Chinese (Simplified) for all content
- **Formatting**: Markdown with LaTeX for mathematical expressions
- **Math Notation**: Use $...$ for inline math and $$...$$ for display math
- **Structure**: Clear section headers with numbered chapters and descriptive titles

## Mathematical Conventions
- Use standard microeconomics notation: $U(x,y)$ for utility, $p_x$ for prices, $MC$ for marginal cost
- Include detailed step-by-step solutions for problems
- Show both algebraic and graphical reasoning where applicable
- Use Chinese economic terminology (消费者剩余, 生产者剩余, 帕累托改进)

## File Organization
- Maintain consistent numbering: "1.导论.md", "2.预算约束.md", etc.
- Keep practice problems in separate "例题/" directory
- Use descriptive file names that reflect content

## Content Quality
- Include both theoretical explanations and practical examples
- Provide clear problem statements and detailed solutions
- Use diagrams and mathematical proofs where appropriate
- Maintain academic rigor while being accessible

## Learning Context
- **Prerequisite**: Basic understanding from Mankiw's introductory economics
- **Current Focus**: Varian's intermediate microeconomics with mathematical emphasis
- **Key Differences**: More rigorous mathematical proofs, optimization problems, and advanced concepts like envelope theorem, Slutsky equation, etc.
